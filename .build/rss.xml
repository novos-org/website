novos is a static site generator (SSG), similar to Hugo, Zola, and Jekyll. It is written in Rust and uses the Tera template engine, which is similar to Jinja2, Django templates, and Liquid.

Content is written in [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), a strongly defined, highly compatible specification of Markdown.

# Storage & Naming
- **Path**: includes/shortcodes/*.html
- **Naming**: The filename (minus the .html extension) becomes the command name.
    - **Example**: includes/shortcodes/notice.html is called via <% .notice %>.
