Shortcodes are reusable HTML components stored in your includes/shortcodes/ directory. They allow you to inject complex UI elements into Markdown and templates without writing inline HTML.

# Storage & Naming
- **Path**: includes/shortcodes/*.html
- **Naming**: The filename (minus the .html extension) becomes the command name.
    - **Example**: includes/shortcodes/notice.html is called via <% .notice %>.

# Invocation Syntax
Shortcodes use a dot-prefix to distinguish them from standard variables or includes.
```html
<% .shortcode_name "arg1" "arg2" "arg3" %>
```

> Arguments with spaces: Wrap them in double quotes. Simple arguments: Quotes are optional if there are no spaces (e.g., `<% .youtube dQw4w9WgXcQ %>`).

# Internal Logic
Inside the .html file, arguments are accessed via indexed variables starting at 1.

| Variable | Usage |
|---|---|
| `<%= a1 =%>` | The first argument passed. |
| `<%= a2 =%>` | The second argument passed. |

And so on.
