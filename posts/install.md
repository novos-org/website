There are three primary install methods:
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/novos-org/novos/releases), [install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/novos-org/novos/main/install.sh), and `cargo install`.

> [!TIP]
> Use binary packages to save time when downloading.


To install using install.sh, run the following command: (To install globally, you need root permissions.)
```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/novos-org/novos/main/install.sh | sh
```

To install using `cargo install`: (This installs novos to `$HOME/.cargo/bin/novos`)
```sh
cargo install novos
```

To install via GitHub releases, visit [github.com/novos-org/novos/releases](https://github.com/novos-org/novos/releases) and download the binary for your operating system / archtype.
